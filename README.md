# Final-Year-Project
## Delta Robot and AcoposTrak
The project aims to offer unique levels of machine flexibility and precision by merging robotics with machine control, enabling remote access, increased efficiency, and saving floor space.
In this project, a machine-centric robot will be controlled for a particular process using Mapp Robotics and an HMI screen will be developed for the robot. The main phase of the project will include the user-friendly programming of robots according to the application using Mapp Technology. Testing and debugging the robotic model on third-party software, where the entire robot can be simulated and the program can be transferred, and the working of the robot can be examined.
The project will also include an advanced technology from B&R Automation, called Acopostrak. It is a track conveyor kind of system that is fast and accurate and will be used to move objects toward processing points.
